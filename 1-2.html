          <h2>Sketching the Cube</h2>

          <p>To start constructing the cube first create a rectangle on the top plane.</p>
          <img src="assets/images/1-2-1.jpg">

          <p>Next we will need to extrude our box into a cube we use the extrude tool on the features tool bar to do this. Set your extrude depth to 1 inch.</p>

          <p>Next we will create another sketch on one face of the cube to create the windows that allow you to see the sphere. Make a circle centered on the plane of diameter .7 inches as shown above.</p>

          <p>We will use the cut extrude tool to cut this window. Select through all for the extrude cut, and repeat until you have a window on each face.</p>
